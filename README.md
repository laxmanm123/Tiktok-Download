# Tiktok-Download
This repository contains the files necessary to download your saved tiktoks to your computer.

Make sure you have enough space in whatever location you are running this program, as there will likely be alot of videos,
for reference, I had about 1200 videos saved which took 4.6 GB. 

It will take a long time, so don't close the terminal until it has completed, it will then close on its own.

If the sound or video was removed, the video will not be downloaded

Target.exe is the executable version of convert-json-txt-win.ps1, feel free to look at the code

I did not create yt-dlp.exe, it is a free and open source video and audio downloading tool that you can find more about here: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp

The purpose of this project is to simplify the steps of the manual process so anyone can do it in 20 seconds.
